Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
this is the branch of Engineering that deal with design, development, testing and maintanance of Software application.

What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional 
programming?
Software Engineering is a the branch of engineering that is cetre arround the entire life cycle of a software.
while Software Engineering is centre around the entire life cycle of a Software development from conception to maintainance, the traditional programming is only centre around code.

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): 
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
the following are the various phases of Software Development:
a. phase 1: planning Stage: this is the initial stage of Software Development, it involves planning and defining the Software purposes and scope.
b. phase 2. Requirement Analysis Stage: this phase seek to identify and record the precise requirement of the final user.
c. phase 3: Design Stage: This involve building the framework to outline the Software Functionality.
d. Phase 4. The coding Stage: this is when Engineer and Deloper convert the Software Design into a tangible code.
e. Phase 5. The Testing Stage: This is the quality Inspection of on a production line to discover any bugs that might have slipped through during coding.
f. Phase 6: Deployement: This is the rolling out of a tested and fine tuned Software to end users.
g. Phase 7. Maintainance Stage: This is characterized by constant assistance and improvement to enhance the longetivity of the Sostware and ensure that it meet customer expectation.

Agile vs. Waterfall Models:  
Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
In comparison, Agile and Waterfall are both project management methodologies and they are both popular in Software Delopment.
But in contrast, Waterfall is a linear system of working that require the team to coplete to complete each project phase before moving to the next while Agile encourage the team to work simmultaneously on different phases of prject.
Waterfall methodology has a fixed timeline and the idea is that the start and finish time of the project are already mapped out from the begining but in the case of Agile, rather than a fixed timeline, the schedule adapt as the time progress.

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Software Design Principles:
Requirements Engineering:
This is the process of identifying, eliciting, analyzing, specifying, validating and managing the need and expectation of stakeholder for a software system.
Below are the Requirement Engieering process:
a. Feasibility Study: this concentrate mainly on technical feasibility, Operational feasibility and economic feasibility.
b. Requirement Elicitation: This is the various ways used to gain knowlwdge about the project domain and requirement.
c. Requirement Specification: This is used to produced formal software requirement models.
d. Requirement verification and validation: The requirement verification is refer to a set of tasks that ensure that the software correctly implement a specific function while Requirement validation is a various set of tasks that ensure that the software that has been built is traceable to customer requirement.
e. Requiremen management: This is the process of analyzing, documenting, prioritizing and agreeing on the requirement and controlling the communication with relevant stakeholder.

The importance of Requirement Engineering include the following:
a. It help to ensure that the Software being developed meet the need and the expectation of stakeholders.
b.It help to identify issue and problem in the early development of the program to allow for adjustment.
c. It help to ensure that the Software is developed in a cost effective and efficient manner.
d. It improve the communication and collaboration between the development team and the stakeholder.
e. It help to ensure that the project meet the expectation of the stakeholder.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a fundermental design principle in software engineering aimed at creating a software in a way that minimizes dependencies among the component of a syste.
The concept of modularity in software design improve the maintainability and scalability in such a way that it help to localize the impact of changes, simplify maintanance and enhances the understandibility of the software system.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
the various level of testing are:
a. Unit testing: This is done at the code level where each component is tested individualy to ensure their impartiality and analyse their functionality.
b.Integration testing: This enable software tester to test group unit integarated into a system or sub-system.
c. System testing: this is perform on integrated enviroment comprising the whole application where all component are accessed against specific business requirement.
d. Acceptance testing: This involve testing the system functional and non functional aspect such as perfomance, security, compatibility and reliability.

Testing is crucial in software development in such a way that it well in debugging an ccorrecting any software error before final deloyement for end user consumption.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version control system is the practice of tracking and managing change to software code.
This is very important in software development system as it help software development team to work faster and smarter.
Example of version control system include the following:
git and some of its feature include, long term change history on every file, branching and merging and traceability, other example of version control system is SVN, CVS and mercurial


Software Project Management:

Discuss the role of a software project manager. What are some key responsibilities and challenges faced in managing software projects?
Software manager are responsible for overseeing and co-ordinating the people, resources and processes required to deliver new software or upgrading existing product.
part of the role of software manager include hand on role in software development, co-ordinating the work of other software proffesionals, learn more about software development role to help in improving the software system.
another role of software manager is scheduling project team member to ensure that team complete project on time.
they also help in assisting team reasources to ensure that team have access to the resource they need to function optimally.
Part of the Problem faced in Managing software product include:
poor communication between team member as this always lead to poor outcome and delayed of project work.
Another problem is Lack of accountability and this is part of problem associated with poor communication as this always affect the outcome of a project .

Software Maintenance:

Define software maintenance and explain the different types of maintenance activities. Why is maintenance an essential part of the software lifecycle?
Software maintainance is the process changing, modifying and updating software to keep up with customer need.
The various type of maintainance activities include:
a. Corrective Software maintainance: this deal with fixing bugs, fauls and error as they are detected.
b. Preventive Software maintainance: this include making change adaptation and upgrade to avoid possible problem in the future.
c. Perfective Software maintenance: This is about adding new features and removing some of the uneffective ones according to the user changing need and feedback.
d. Adaptive Software maintenance: This focuses on adjusting the software to certain change in its enviroment.
Maintenance is essential simply because it reduces the cost of adding new features and services.

Ethical Considerations in Software Engineering:

What are some ethical issues that software engineers might face? How can software engineers ensure they adhere to ethical standards in their work?
below are some of the ethical issues face by software engineer:
The upholding of user privacy and data security is one the most important ethical factor in Software development.
Software Engineer can ensure that they adhre to ethical standard by in their work by adhere to lay down rules of the organisation they find their self as well as promoting accountability within team member.
